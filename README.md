# Data Scientist Salary Predictor

### Project Overview
Built a data science salary predictor capable of making salary predictions based on job location, title, skills required, seniority among other parameters. The data is scraped off Glassdoor job postings using Selenium Web Scraper for data scraping. The data is cleaned and suitable feature engineering is peformed to prepare the parameters that can help us make accurate predictions. Exploratory Data Analysis is performed to understand the relationship between different parameters and on the salary. Finally, linear regression, lasso regression and random forest regression are implemented. Random Forest regressor provided the best Mean Absolute Error, followed by Lasso regression.
