Data Scientist,$93K-$149K (Glassdoor est.),"About Netskope

Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.

Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, San Francisco, Seattle, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.

As a Senior Data Engineer, you will report to the Head of Data and work closely with other members of the Data team to maintain and improve data pipelines, deploy predictive models as a service, and work on our data infrastructure.

Team Philosophy:
We believe that data engineers should not write ETL, unless data pipelines are necessary to support the services that we build and maintain. Instead, your time is better spent writing tooling and creating abstractions to support the work of analysts and data scientists on the team, so that other users in the company can write and maintain their own ETL.
Everyone on the team is considered and treated as a Senior, so you are given a lot of ownership over the projects you're working on. With this in mind, we expect you to write code that is well tested, modular, and maintainable. We frown at instances of destructive fire fighting, caused by badly designed architecture or mismanaged projects.
We like learners. Hence, we create an environment where Data Scientists learn the skills and abstraction patterns of Software Engineers and Data Engineers learn the iterative model development workflow seen in Machine Learning. Expect an environment where you will be constantly learning and challenged to interact with tools, languages, frameworks that are outside of your area of expertise.
Tools, Frameworks, and Languages you will work with:
Languages: Python, Scala, and occasionally R and Node.js
Storage: Postgres, Redshift, S3
Compute: Spark, Athena, EC2
Workflow Management: Airflow
Infrastructure: Terraform, Kubernetes
Potential Projects:
Deploy trained machine learning models as a Python microservice.
Help migrate legacy ETLs into Airflow
Write tooling to make ETL accessible to engineers on other teams.
Ideal background and expertise:
5+ years of experience as a full-time professional data engineer
Experience with server-side concepts, e.g. microservices, database, caching, performance, monitoring and scalability
3+ years of experience with Python or Scala
Working experience with OLTP databases such as Postgres, MySQL
Extensive experience making data available in OLAP databases such as Redshift or Snowflake
Experience with orchestration tools such as Airflow (preferred), Luigi, Ooozie
Nice to Have:
Familiarity with Business Intelligence tools such as Tableau, Looker, Superset
Domain experience developing software for Fintech, Banking, or related Consumer Financial Services companies

Who You Are:
You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.
You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You are a broadly skilled data scientist with experience embedding models into always-on production systems, working across a variety of technologies and data sources.

You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work.

You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.
What We Consider as Advantages:
You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.
You are comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.
You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.
You have over 3 years of experience working in a data-driven role.

Before the dawn of everything internet, insurance was intimate and personal. You walked down the street to chat with your broker, and the risk to your business, your livelihood, was covered with a handshake. Today things are different. The average insurance policy for a mom-and-pop store trades through a dozen different hands and traverses a maze of systems and processes. Few are accountable and fewer know the whole story.

We seek a data scientist to help drive a new digital AI product team on a mission to unlock the potential of data and identify new opportunities.

As one of the founding members of a small, multi-disciplinary team of technologists, designers and product managers, you’ll have the freedom to make key product decisions without much oversight, and the tools and resources to build and ship ideas quickly. You’ll be a part of a startup-like environment, with the opportunity to have more control and leadership; in a company with thousands of existing customers.

You have experience with relational databases such as PostgreSQL, Oracle or SQL Server, and maybe even Hadoop, Hive, Spark or Redshift.
You strive to learn the newest and greatest techniques where BERT/ELMo are not just Sesame Street© characters.
What you’ll own
The foundation for advanced analytics at a global company.
The roadmap of projects you’ll work on that tie directly to business goals and objectives.
Manage the entire lifecycle of data projects from strategic planning to tactical activities (data collection, cleanup, analysis, model implementation).
Sourcing new data for a firm that rarely scrapes, pulls or pushes.
Facilitate communication throughout the development process between executive stakeholders, your users and technical teams.

You will report directly to our Head of Data Science and have day-to-day exposure to multiple members of the company leadership team. You will be joining a small, nimble team of 5+ scientists, with lots of room for growth and impact.
Responsibilities:


Research and develop predictive models (we typically start with a POC and then work with Product and Engineering counterparts to transition to production).

Iterate and pivot quickly to deliver MVP solutions. Design quick experiments to maximize learning.

Understand the data and dig deep to extract actionable insights.

Think creatively and outside the box to answer desired experimental questions.

Work cross-functionally with engineering, product, marketing, business intelligence, insurance operations, customer support, senior management, and external partners.

Desired Skills and Experience:


4+ years of hands-on experience in data mining, machine learning, and/or statistical analysis.

MS/Ph.D. in Computer Science, Statistics, Applied Math, or related areas from a top university.

Experience in writing both agile exploratory analyses as well as production-level code in a fast-paced environment.

Ability to communicate the results of analyses clearly and effectively.

Develop and evaluate computational models for people-counting and identifying behaviors on smart mats
Implement these models in code, so that they are call-able from a Python framework
Communicate model characteristics and performance to technical and non-technical associates
Create charts to visualize raw data and model performance

Who you are:
Interest in understanding human behavior patterns (e.g., why did this group of people enter to the left instead of the right?)
Independent worker who is a specialist within a small team
Will run experiments and test algorithm performance in terms of correctly counting occupancy on the mat and perimeter crossings (i.e., entrances and exits)
Communicate and formally report on results, needed improvements and requirements to hardware team and Chief Scientist, and Dont Be Afraid to Speak Up on setting expectations of algorithm performance and enjoining team to run testing when needed
Have a Get Shit Done attitude that means you bring algorithms to a state of completion rather than perfection, so that they can be deployed to our customers
Demonstrate Practical Curiosity to understand how the analytics fit into the rest of the business and how to create even better and more useable sensors

Before the dawn of everything internet, insurance was intimate and personal. You walked down the street to chat with your broker, and the risk to your business, your livelihood, was covered with a handshake. Today things are different. The average insurance policy for a mom-and-pop store trades through a dozen different hands and traverses a maze of systems and processes. Few are accountable and fewer know the whole story.

The roadmap of projects you’ll work on that tie directly to business goals and objectives.
Manage the entire lifecycle of data projects from strategic planning to tactical activities (data collection, cleanup, analysis, model implementation).
Sourcing new data for a firm that rarely scrapes, pulls or pushes.
Facilitate communication throughout the development process between executive stakeholders, your users and technical teams.
Coordinate and build strong working relations with various internal stakeholder groups, including IT, engineering, and legal.
Minimum Qualifications
Degree in computer science, engineering, mathematics, statistics, data science or a related technical field, or equivalent practical experience.

Before the dawn of everything internet, insurance was intimate and personal. You walked down the street to chat with your broker, and the risk to your business, your livelihood, was covered with a handshake. Today things are different. The average insurance policy for a mom-and-pop store trades through a dozen different hands and traverses a maze of systems and processes. Few are accountable and fewer know the whole story.

You have experience with relational databases such as PostgreSQL, Oracle or SQL Server, and maybe even Hadoop, Hive, Spark or Redshift.
You strive to learn the newest and greatest techniques where BERT/ELMo are not just Sesame Street© characters.
What you’ll own
The foundation for advanced analytics at a global company.
The roadmap of projects you’ll work on that tie directly to business goals and objectives.
Manage the entire lifecycle of data projects from strategic planning to tactical activities (data collection, cleanup, analysis, model implementation).
Sourcing new data for a firm that rarely scrapes, pulls or pushes.
Facilitate communication throughout the development process between executive stakeholders, your users and technical teams.
Coordinate and build strong working relations with various internal stakeholder groups, including IT, engineering, and legal.

Senior Data Engineer,$110K-$163K (Glassdoor est.),"Healthcare’s helping hand.
COVID-19 precaution: Due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, our hiring process will now be completely virtual. All interviews and onboarding activities will be held online or over the phone. We remain committed to putting our people, customers, and communities first and appreciate your patience and flexibility as we work through this.
The (quality) doctor is in.
Modio has streamlined the convoluted and messy process that is healthcare credentialing and saved countless years of manual and error-prone work in the process. As part of CHG Healthcare we are working to drastically improve the speed (and quality) of credentialing to ensure that our doctors can spend more time treating (millions) of patients each year and less time dealing with credentialing headaches.
Our industry is growing and demand is high. This means you’ll have plenty of opportunities to grow and develop in your career. Keeping healthcare healthy can be as fun as it is rewarding.
We are open to this role being in our offices in Salt Lake City, Utah or San Francisco, California.
Your role:
Three database admins walked into a nosql bar. A little while later they walked out because they couldn’t find a table.
On a more serious note, we are looking for a data engineer. This role spans many different technical disciplines, but the overarching goals are straightforward:
Automate the ingress/egress of data from the OneView platform.
Ensure that all the data in the OneView platform is high quality (and automate the process of identifying/fixing low quality/missing data).
In this role you’ll be doing a little bit of everything to accomplish these goals. Whether that means writing new API functionality to import data, setting up/maintaining automated data pipelines, or working on advanced reporting systems is up to you. Consider yourself the glue that makes all of our data accessible and “up to snuff.” This is a highly collaborative and highly visible role; complex systems are not developed in isolation!
A little about our tech stack:
AWS
CloudFormation/Terraform
Kubernetes/Istio
js/TypeScript
Pentaho Data Integration
MySQL/Aurora
If you’re an ambitious product-minded engineer who plays well with others AND can say yes to all of these statements, we are looking for you!
You are a doer. Whether you are coming up with projects that align with our vision or helping others do the same, you are doing it proactively.
You understand how to design software and systems that are maintainable, robust, easy to understand, and capable of scaling. You also know that not every solution needs to be over-engineered.
You should be able to debug technical issues, even if the issue isn’t from “your code” or “your system”.
Your qualifications:
5+ years’ experience working with production data. Must understand things like data normalization, relational databases, data cleansing, data sandboxing, data pipelines, BI/ETL tools, and a bunch of other stuff.
Strong proficiency writing SQL. Reading SQL is a plus.
Experience working with data integration like Pentaho (or similar).
Experience setting up and maintaining data pipelines.
Professional experience working on backend API code (Node.js/TypeScript Preferred but not a hard requirement). Familiarity with defensive coding practices preferred.
Experience working on a scrum team in an agile environment.

More than a job


Where you work isn't just a career decision -- it's a life decision. We get it. That's why we want all of our Gurus to feel a sense of belonging that comes from feeling supported in all areas of their lives. Everyone has family, friends and interests outside of their careers, so we offer perks and benefits to make work, work better for you.
4 weeks PTO, plus 10 sick days, and holidays. Whether it's hiking to a waterfall in Costa Rica or bonding with your couch, we all need downtime. All Gurus get four weeks paid time off, 10 sick days, and enough holiday to make a banker blush.
Let's get lunch. Lunches are catered three times per week, and our kitchen stays stocked with a smorgasbord of the team's most requested snacks and drinks.
Parking is on us. We have your Downtown parking covered. We offer paid garage parking nearby the office. We also have perks for going green by walking and taking public transit.

$1,000 continuing education budget. All Gurus get $250 a quarter to spend on personal development, and 2 hours each week reserved for learning something new.
What's the interview process like at ACG?


Applying for a job can feel intimidating and like a full-time job of its own. You shouldn't have to burn through a week of sick time or all your best out-of-office excuses just to put feelers out for a new career opportunity. We want to be as transparent about the process as possible to help ease your mind. It's our goal to provide you a fair, efficient interviewing experience that respects you and your time and to do it all with a sidecar of delight.

Once you submit an application, we'll review it. If you're a good fit, you'll have an initial chat with a recruiter over the phone. A phone interview with a manager typically follows. Depending on your role, you might then be asked to do a little homework (but nothing too time consuming). Then we'll schedule a Zoom call to meet other members of the team, answer any questions you have, and give you a feel for what it's really like to work at ACG. If you're on the fence, just give it a try.

Keep being awesome, Cloud Gurus.",4,"A Cloud Guru

Senior Data Scientist (Computer Vision/Natural Language Processing),$80K-$94K (Glassdoor est.),"Create the model that transforms the mortgage industry


Want to infuse a $20B sector of the insurance and real estate industry with predictive analytics and a tech-forward customer experience? Yearning for a startup culture within a profitable nationwide company? Join States Title and send an entirely new type of real estate model into the wild.

Every mortgage or refinance transaction requires our product: title and escrow. Title insurance protects banks and homeowners against financially irresponsible actors or legal issues that cloud their rights; escrow makes sure the right people get paid at the end of the day.

In an uncertain real estate market, lenders, banks and realtors are dying to know how to boost their margins. They are switching their customers to States Title because our data science algorithms, streamlined deal closing technologies, and overall product experience is leaps and bounds above what they're used to in terms of speed and value in title and escrow.

Our streamlined algorithms have revolutionized the title and escrow process and allowed us to scale rapidly: we closed our acquisition of North American Title Company in early 2019 to go from startup to #8 in the country. With a broader nationwide footprint and a huge data set for machine learning, we are poised to transform this industry. We will repurpose the billions wasted in rote, manual tasks to make homeownership easier and less risky, helping people invest time and money into more meaningful parts of their lives.

We're growing our document parsing data science team


We're looking for someone who is fired up to automate the manual labor currently associated with ingesting, reviewing, and reconciling the dozens of types of documents that need comprehension during a real estate transaction. This means everything from using advanced optical character recognition techniques to parse scanned documents, to using computer vision to extract the contents, natural language processing to check their validity and action them.

As a data scientist at States Title, you'll take part in a fun and respectful corporate atmosphere. You'll interact frequently with an executive team that has significant accomplishments at Oracle, PayPal, McKinsey, and Capital One behind them. Much more than a model builder, you'll talk directly with VP+ customers and stakeholders, vet and negotiate deals with vendors, recommend strategies to change the direction of the company, and discuss data stewardship and model governance with deep legal minds in the public and private sectors.

We're proud of the sophisticated data ingestion process we have built, as well as the multi-model ecosystem that is already live, with its parts working together to orchestrate an instant insurance decision in a robust, well-managed, and well-tested way. We have high expectations of communication, accountability, and mathematical rigor, and are looking for those who would be inspired and stimulated in such an environment.

Do you have what it takes?
3-10 years of relevant experience in data science
Excitement about delivering industry-shaking document parsing algorithms using natural language processing (NLP) and/or computer vision (CV) is a requirement
Experience in the above fields is a plus, but not required: we will consider all accomplished persons in any area of data science who are fired up to innovate in the NLP/CV area
Strengths aligned with our needs
E.g. Can you explain how convolutional kernels or attention mechanisms work without making reference to computers?
E.g. When you write a python library that tests the score distribution of incoming orders against expectation, does Engineering praise the quality of your code?
E.g. When out-of-the-box regression on a continuous target isn't good enough, can you come up with a customized loss function for the problem?
E.g. Can you get a group to make a controversial decision in fewer than 30 minutes?
We want to help you do the best work of your life


We believe the most valuable investment we can make — and the greatest boost we can give your career — is an exceptional team of colleagues who are passionate about what we are doing.

We currently offer the following benefits and will continually evolve them with the goal of efficiently attracting, retaining, and leveraging the very highest quality talent.
